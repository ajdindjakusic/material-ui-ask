## Setting up

- App is created with create-raect-app, for learning purpose, while building Ask-app from scratch

## Starting the project:

- run npm start in root folder

## What is working?

- So far, there is only one fetch request in Homepage that gets all the questions from ask-app server and mySQL database

## Notes

- JWT implementation files not completed
- Folders Dto, Middleware and Service are just boilerplates imported for learning how it works
